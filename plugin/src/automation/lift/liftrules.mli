(*

(*
 * When an optimization may be possible, we return one of these.
 * Sometimes, we need more information to determine if the optimization is
 * definitely possible. This just makes it very explicit in the code what
 * is an attempt at an optimization, as opposed to what is needed for
 * correctness only.
 *
 * See the implementation for an explanation of each of these.
